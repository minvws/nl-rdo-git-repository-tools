## Contribution process

The development team works on the repository in a private fork (for reasons of compliance with existing processes) and shares its work as often as possible.

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend to open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes.
This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

You can follow this flow:
1. Fork the repository, eg for CoronaCheck on Android: https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-coronacheck-app-android/fork
2. Create a branch based on main and commit all your changes. Preferably name your branch either using the pattern
   feature/yourBranchName if you are contributing something new or bugfix/yourBranchName if you are fixing a bug.
   Please try to use clear commit messages which reflect your thinking and rationale.
   Instead of writing "Increase bottom padding" write "Fully display the bottom button on mdpi devices"
3. When ready, open a pull request to the public repo.
   Easiest way is to click on contribute from the github user interface from your fork.
4. The team will review and test your changes, merge them to main and sync them back to the public repo. 
5. This will close the original PR.

Note that all commits should be signed using a GPG key.
